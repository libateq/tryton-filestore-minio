Tryton FileStore MinIO
######################

The *Tryton FileStore MinIO* package allows Tryton's FileStore to be configured
to use S3 compatible object storage services.
It can be setup to store files in different buckets, or with different service
providers depending on the prefix used with the FileStore.
This package uses the MinIO Python SDK library to communicate with the S3
services.
